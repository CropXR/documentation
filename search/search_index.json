Since its creation in 2012 by Nick Craig-Wood, Rclone has become an essential tool for system administrators, developers, and tech-savvy individuals who need to efficiently handle data across multiple cloud environments. With its robust encryption capabilities, extensive configuration options, and ability to handle files of virtually any size, Rclone provides a versatile solution for both personal and enterprise cloud storage management needs. </p> <p>Reference instructions for mounting on Windows by SURF can be found here These steps overlap with the instructions below.

When set to \"writes\", this option means:</p> <ul> <li>Files opened for reading are not cached initially</li> <li>Files opened for writing are cached during the entire upload</li> <li>File data read from the remote while a file is open is cached</li> </ul> <p>The <code>--use-cookies</code> flag in Rclone enables the use of cookies for authentication and session management when connecting to remote servers, particularly WebDAV servers like Research Drive (which is based on OwnCloud).</p> <p>Replace the paths in the example command with the actual path needed. The path of the folder on the research drive, should be either the complete path, or the path that is visible to/shared with the user. This likely looks like this for the full path <code>cropxr:cropxr (Projectfolder)/investigations/investigation_folder/study_folder</code> or like this for shared folders <code>cropxr:study_folder</code></p> <p>Best practice is to mount a specific folder (e.g., <code>WPC1</code>) rather than the root of Research Drive.
