# Introduction

## Metadata
All the research produced in the CropXR consortium will be well annotated with metadata following the CropXR standards. 

The metadata annotation will have multiple uses:
  - Findability of your study, by other researchers in the consortium
  - Reusability of your data by other users in the consortium
  - Improvement of your own data annotation

The responsibility to annotate the data lies with the researcher, with the help and tools provided by DataXR.


#### Model flexibility
A standardized metadata format ensures that the metadata has a predictable structure. 
There are however many different types of studies in the consortium, with different metadata that is important. 
To fit all different studies in the same format there is a certain flexibility in the model.
This puts some responsibility on the researcher for how to use this format and to really understand the model. 
These documents should provide the information needed to make those choices. 
For the first time entering metadata, plan sufficient time to understand the model.
If you are stuck at any point, things are unclear, or you need help, please reach out to the DataXR team at data@cropxr.org


#### Catalogue
The metadata is currently collected in Excel templates. 
The metadata that is collected in these templates, will be imported into a catalogue. 
In this catalogue people of the consortium can find studies, view and download the metadata en view the associated data. 
In the catalogue, the data producing researchers will also be able to manage who can view their study. 
It will be made available to you as soon as possible.

## Data
The data storage is currently the Research Drive. In the future there might be other data storages added. The metadata will include a link to where the data is stored.
