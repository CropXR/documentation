## Metadata
All the research produced in the CropXR consortium will be well annotated with metadata following the CropXR standards. 

The metadata annotation will have multiple uses:
- Findability of your study, by other researchers in the consortium
- Reusability of your data by other users in the consortium
- Improvement of your own data annotation

The responsibility to annotate the data lies with the researcher, with the help and tools provided by DataXR.

A standardized metadata format ensures that the metadata has a predictable structure. 
However, the format also accommodates for many type of studies within the consortium. 
This means that there is a certain flexibility in the model, to adapt to the different studies/
This puts some responsibility on the researcher for how to use this format and to really understand the model. 
These documents should provide the information needed to make those choices. 
For the first time entering metadata, plan sufficient time to understand the model.
If you are stuck at any point, things are unclear, or you need help, please reach out to the DataXR team at data@cropxr.org

The metadata is currently collected in Excel templates. 
The metadata that is collected in these templates, will be imported into a catalogue. 
In this catalogue people of the consortium can find studies, view and download the metadata en view the associated data. 
In the catalogue, the data producing researchers will also be able to manage who can view their study. 
It will be made available to you as soon as possible.

## Data
The data storage is currently the Research Drive. In the future there might be other data storages added. The metadata will include a link to where the data is stored.


# Stepwise guide

## Preparations

1. Understand the basic structure of the [metadata model](introduction-metadata-model.md).
2. Decide on the [what experiments to group into the study](defining-a-study.md).
3. Choose the study type (sequencing, phenotyping or combined). Inform DataXR well up front when your study does not fit these types.
4. Make sure that you have registered your study in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe9rk7LtjOclKu9pKlmXMf-xUMzVUVFpYVkxZTE9VNTFXTVBMSU1EN1paTC4u). After the admin has checked the registration, you will receive a study id you need when entering the metadata, as well as storage for your experimental data.
6. Gather the files with the metadata that you already collected. This includes e-lab journal entries, files that outline experimental conditions per plant, files that link output files to the experiment, etc.


## Data Upload

Pre-requisites: 
- [access to the Research Drive](research-drive/How-to-get-access.md)
- Choose a method of [data upload](research-drive/Uploading-data.md), depending on your data size, and set up the required tools.

1. Make a plan of [what data should be uploaded](../what-data-to-upload.md) and how it should be organised in folders.
2. Upload the data.
