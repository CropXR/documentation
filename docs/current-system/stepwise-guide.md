## Preparations

1. Understand the basic structure of the [metadata model](introduction-metadata-model.md).
2. Decide on the [what experiments to group into the study](defining-a-study.md).
3. Choose the study type (sequencing, phenotyping or combined). Inform DataXR well up front when your study does not fit these types.
4. Make sure that you have registered your study in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe9rk7LtjOclKu9pKlmXMf-xUMzVUVFpYVkxZTE9VNTFXTVBMSU1EN1paTC4u). After the admin has checked the registration, you will receive a study id you need when entering the metadata, as well as storage for your experimental data.
6. Gather the files with the metadata that you already collected. This includes e-lab journal entries, files that outline experimental conditions per plant, files that link output files to the experiment, etc.


## Data Upload

Pre-requisites: 
- [access to the Research Drive](research-drive/How-to-get-access.md)
- Choose a method of [data upload](research-drive/Uploading-data.md), depending on your data size, and set up the required tools.

1. Make a plan of [what data should be uploaded](../what-data-to-upload.md) and how it should be organised in folders.
2. Upload the data inside your designated study folder.


## Minimal metadata entry
Decide how to the metadata should be entered, to capture all information that is needed, by grouping conditions and samples. In the web interface, fill in all the fields that are essential to understand the study, focusing on key aspects, such as species and assay type. In this phase you also link the data to the performed experiments, so others can find and understand your data. 


## Improving metadata
At any point in time you can save the metadata and edit it later. Add the additional metadata that was collected, and improves the re-usability of your data.


## Other things

### Adding columns
hmmm as little as possible

### Combined study
