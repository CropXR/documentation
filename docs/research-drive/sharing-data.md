1. **Select the Folder/File**: Navigate to the folder or file you want to share and select it, click on the three dots.

## Sharing Guidelines
1. Sharing Rules:
    - Only share folders with the workpackage prefix (e.g. 'WPXYZ-')
    - Never share non-prefixed folders (e.g., 'studies', 'assays', 'raw')
    - Always share from the nearest parent folder with 'WPXYZ-' prefix
    - This ensures unique folder names and prevents conflicts
    - Once you uploaded a dataset, remove the write/change/delete permissions for everyone, to keep the data safe
2. Examples:
    - ✅ CORRECT: Share 'WPXYZ-seq1'
    - ❌ INCORRECT: Share 'assays' or 'raw' folders directly
