
## [WIP] What data to upload  

Think about the purpose

Standards will be developed by the consortium during the time of the consortium

Reach out to each other (link slack channel)


## Raw data

This makes it possible to re-use data from different studies and process it all in the exact same way.

Legal requirement.

What is raw data? (e.g. not pod5, yes fastq)


## Processed data
Output artifacts that considered valuable.
These might be used by researchers to understand the study and it's outcomes.
The data might also be used directly in a secondary analysis, 
especially if the data was produced by one of the CropXR standerdized pipelines or scripts.
Do not include intermediates that can be regenerated from the raw data and have no direct value.

Typically included:
- count tables

Typically not included:
- graphs used in the paper
- BAMs
