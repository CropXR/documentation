The ResilienceHub uses FairdomSEEK with ISA settings as the metadata catalogue. This document describes how metadata can be uploaded in the right format. This document contains a detailed step by step guide for first time data entry. A shorter reference guide for additional studies will be included later.


There is a format to stick to, but also the format accommodates for many type of studies, so it leaves room to fill out differently. This puts some responsibility on the researcher for how to use this format and to really understand the model. The documents guide you through the choices you need to make, and how you can make them. Do plan time for this, especially the first time.  If you are stuck at any point, things are unclear or you need help, please reach out to the DataXR team at data@cropxr.org


## Process outline

We suggest you do phase 0 a few days before you plan to do your metadata entry and that you do step 1 and 2 in one session. 
 
### Phase 0: preparations

Get an overview over the process and prepare data entry. Importantly, **read this document all the way through** (except the detailed step-wise instructions of phase 2, 3 and 4). Try to understand the process, the metadata model, and the concepts. You will define the study by choosing what experiments to include and make sure you are **registered upfront**. An admin from DataXR might need to approve requests, so make sure to do this a few days before your planned data entry. You gather files that contain metadata regarding your study.

### Phase 1: define study, assays and sample templates

In the web interface, create (an investigation and) study. Choose what fields to include in your study to properly capture the metadata. Define assays for the experiments performed in the study. 

 
### Phase 2: critical metadata entry

Decide how to the metadata should be entered, to capture all information that is needed, by grouping conditions and samples. In the web interface, fill in all the fields that are essential to understand the study, focusing on key aspects, such as species and assay type. In this phase you also link the data to the performed experiments, so others can find and understand your data. 

 
### Phase 3: improving metadata

When the fields have been defined, at any point in time you can save the metadata and edit it later. Add the additional metadata that was collected, and improves the re-usability of your data. You can also manage who can see your metadata at any time.
