# Short guide

Detailed instructions are found [here](metadata-entry-seek.md)

Prepare

1. register the study in the form and get storage 
2. gather relevant documents, such as lab notes and experimental design overviews

Start with the metadata entry in FairdomSEEK

3. create a study
      1. choose an extended metadata type
      2. set the sharing of the study
      3. choose a template for the study source. Add additional fields if needed.
      4. choose a template for the study sample (sample only, observation unit, or combined)
4. for each assay type create an assay stream
      1. select the right extended metadata
      2. set the sharing
5. within the assay stream create one or more assays 
      1. choose a sample template that fits the type of assay (choose between material and data file + choose the full or condensed + choose sequencing or observation)
      2. add additional fields if needed
      3. add additional assays for data files that were generate from the first assay output

Now the study has been defined, continue with the minimally needed metadata.

6. Register Data files by linking the URL to the file or folder. Manage the permissions on the file. 
7. Register protocols under SOPs and manage the permissions. 
8. Edit the study to fill the extend metadata and link SOPs.
9. Define sources, based on your specific study and the level of granularity needed.

   Enter the data by downloading the template, filling the data and uploading.
10. Define samples/observation units, based on your specific study and the level of granularity needed.

    Enter the data by downloading the template, filling the data, referencing the study sources by name and id, and uploading the template in the interface.
11. Edit assay metadata 
12. Enter assay row data + link data files

Now that the minimal metadata is added, continue improving the metadata.

13. adapt permissions 
14. update with additional data
