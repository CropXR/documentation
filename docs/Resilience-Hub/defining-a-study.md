As a researcher you are free to define studies as you need. Here are some tips and constraints to help you.

Investigation - larger topic with several standalone subquestions. Size of PhD, or the work of several researchers combined. Typically a PI will have a plan for how the investigations are defined.

Study - roughly the size of a paper. A standalone set of relevant data that together answers a research question. Multiple people can work together on a study.

If multiple experiments are performed on the same plant and they need to be combined to come to an understanding these experiments should be grouped in a study. It is not possible to directly reference plants/samples in another study. If plants are grown in the same batch, but separated, to perform different analyses and answer different questions they are likely best separated into different studies. Simply copy the growth conditions.

While CropXR does not require this, MIAPPE assumes that a study is in a single location. If you wish to stay close to the MIAPPE format, be sure to separate measurements performed at different locations into different studies.
